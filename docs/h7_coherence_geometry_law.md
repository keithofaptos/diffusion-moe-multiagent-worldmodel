# H₇ Coherence Geometry Law (Proposed)

**A Scale-Invariant Fixed Point of Residual Error Dynamics**  
**Author:** James Paul Jackson  
**Date:** January 2026

## Abstract

We propose the H₇ Coherence Geometry Law as a geometric law, not a numerical constant. Across systems, coherence converges under residual error after alignment, nonlinear weighting, and cusp-limited stability. The ~0.70–0.72 band is a projection-dependent shadow of this scale-invariant fixed point.

## README-Level Claim

**Proposed Law:** H₇ is a geometric law describing a universal fixed point of coherence under residual error dynamics.

- Governs stable organization under noise/drift.
- Predicts convergence to interior coherence ridge.
- Numerical ~0.70–0.72 shifts predictably with reparameterization.
- Breaking geometry destroys convergence.

## Core Components

### Residual Error
ΔΦ(t): Irreducible misalignment after canonical alignment.

Coherence:  
C(t) = 1 / (1 + |ΔΦ(t)|)

### Nonlinear Weighting
Ω(t) = 1 / (1 + |ΔΦ(t)|)  
Induces curved geometry favoring coherent regions.

### Cusp-Limited Stability
High-error states collapse rapidly; survival constrains contributions.

## Fixed-Point Emergence
Combined dynamics flow to stable ridge:  
⟨C⟩ → ~0.70–0.72

## Toy Model
Heavy-tailed ΔΦ + weighting + cusp → interior maximum coherence.

## Relation to Earlier Results
Matches peak of U(C) = C⁷(1-C)³ at 0.7.

## Falsification
- Remove alignment → dispersion
- Remove weighting → shift/vanish
- Remove cusp → lower mean
- Change mapping → predictable shift

## Interpretation
Stable systems achieve highest survivable coherence, not perfect (fragile).
